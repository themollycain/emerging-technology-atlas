When launching the Venture Capital Sub-Committee for the Emerging Citizen inititive, we leaned on one primary mission goal: to positively influence the implementation of innovation across the government. 

To make this happen, we're driving toward a more relationship-driven, shared vantage point with top investment leaders and organizations from within the venture capital system - all who have their finger firmly on the pulse of emerging technologies and future trends all over the world.

While executives in the federal space may not necessarily have the means, the budget or the bandwidth to immediately invest or incubate the innovative solutions of tomorrow, we believe it's our responsibility to inform them of what's to come, what other federal and industry organizations are seeing as critical priorities in today's tech space and serve as an information point of awareneness and opportunities. We know that we do not know all that we need to know. And we're thrilled to connect with the Venture Capital ecosystem to provide that insight for us. 

In this sub-committee, our chairing organizations will be working closely alongside the Venture Capital community to bring initiatives, awareness, opportunities, roundtables, collaborations and knowledge sharing sessions in an effort to connect our federal/state/local government systems to the top industry experts, trends, conversations and technologies in the world.  

Chairing Organizations: 
* Department of Homeland Security (Office of Venture and Innovation) 
* FBI
* State Department
* USAID
* DOE
* Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)
